			<h3>InstinctAct<sup>TM</sup> – "Instinct to Action"</h3>
			<p>Through the power of AI and it’s machine learning algorithms and the vast data collected from IoT devices and sensors, we have built our own proprietary Cloud based AI platform, InstinctAct<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
			<p>The platform learns the user's daily habits and intuitively responds to their needs – using logic and machine learning algorithms to make decisions on performing certain actions without the user having to access the App each time.</p>
			<p>Large data generated by the devices, actuators and sensors is analyzed by the machine learning algorithms’ and statistical techniques deployed by InstinctAct<sup>TM</sup> platform to find patterns, correlations and anomalies and it informs the user or emergency contact etc; when necessary. As the data generated by the user gets larger, algorithm improves in accuracy and efficiency in its decision making.</p>
