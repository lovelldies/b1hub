		<p>The B.One Hub is a universal remote control &ndash; your one-stop destination that allows you to consolidate the control of the various remote controls in your home. You can control all the devices using your smartphone. Better still, you also have the option to engage with the ChatBot via the Line Messenger App and issue specific commands that fulfill specific actions on your behalf, such as turning on the lights, opening the front door and much more.</p>

		<p>Using the ChatBot is easy with a range of intuitive options to choose from. For example, while chatting with the ChatBot you can type a command like 'devices' to see a list of all devices connected to your B.One Hub. You can then proceed to take other actions such as clicking at specific points on the screen to turn them on/off - it's that simple.</p>

		<p>Here's how you can control your B.One Hub via the Line Messenger ChatBot:</p>

		<p>First, download the Line Messenger Android or iOS App to your phone: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.naver.line.android&hl=en" target="_blank">Android</a> / <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/line/id443904275?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>.</p>

		<p>Then, connect to your custom B.One Hub through the search option in the Line Messenger app. Next, enter the custom URL given to you (also available on the B.One website), and log in using your B.One credentials in order to successfully pair with your Hub. Once connected, you can give commands and perform other functions via the Line Messenger ChatBot.</p>
