    <p>The B.One Hub is a universal remote control – your one-stop destination that allows you to consolidate the control of the various remote controls in your home. You can control all the devices using your smartphone. Better still, you also have the option to engage with the ChatBot via the Line Messenger App and issue specific commands that fulfill specific actions on your behalf, such as turning on the lights, opening the front door and much more.</p>
    
    <p>Using the ChatBot is easy with a range of intuitive options to choose from. For example, while chatting with the ChatBot you can type a command like 'devices' to see a list of all devices connected to your B.One Hub. You can then proceed to take other actions such as clicking at specific points on the screen to turn them on/off - it's that simple.</p>

    <p>Here's how you can control your B.One Hub via the Line Messenger ChatBot:</p>

    <ul class="page-ul">
      <li>Locking or unlocking doors (Linkey Locks)</li>
      <li>Turning connected devices ON/OFF
      <li>IR remote control</li>
      <li>Setting the security status of your home to "Arm" "Disarm" or "In-house"</li>
      <li>Performing actions that have already been created in the B.One app</li>
      <li>Managing an account, Adding Guest Users, and Help &amp; Support</li>
      <li>Switching cameras ON/OFF (BESEYE)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>First, download the Line Messenger Android or iOS App to your phone: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.naver.line.android&hl=en" target="_blank">Android</a> / <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/line/id443904275?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>.</p>

    <strong>Note:</strong> B.One Bot for Line messenger will be released in Dec 2017.</p>
