			<p>B.One’s VoiceAct<sup>TM</sup> harnesses existing AI for smart homes by creating skills for Amazon and
				Google to instruct <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Automation-Inc-One-VoiceAct/dp/B01MTXPGH6" target="_blank">Alexa</a> and Google home to command and control B.One<sup>TM</sup> connected smart
				home devices. B.One<sup>TM</sup> users are already using our VoiceAct<sup>TM</sup> platform to control and monitor
				diverse portfolio of smart home devices like Thermostats, Cameras, Switches, Dimmers, Door
				Locks and many more devices built based on well established wireless protocols like Z-Wave,
				Zigbee, Wi-Fi, BLE. With over 27,000 models of Infrared remotes supported by B.One<sup>TM</sup> Hub,
				Our VoiceAct<sup>TM</sup> platform provides total control of legacy and modern Infrared controlled
				devices like Televisions, Disc players, Airconditioning systems and such others.</p>
				
				<p>The B.One<sup>TM</sup> VoiceAct<sup>TM</sup> can be added to the Alexa or Google Home app and devices connected
					to the B.One<sup>TM</sup> Hub can be controlled directly via voice commands issued to Alexa and Google
					Home devices. Imagine waking up in the morning and saying &quot;Alexa, turn on Good morning&quot; to
					then have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Automation-Inc-One-VoiceAct/dp/B01MTXPGH6" target="_blank">Alexa</a> automatically turn on the coffee machine and the geyser! The possibilities are
					many – you can easily create and customize an exhaustive list of voice commands and their
					associated actions in the backend. Controlling individual devices is easy, too, thanks to the
					ability to recognize devices and respond appropriately to commands like &quot;Ok Google, turn TV
					off.&quot;</p>
				
				<p>Try VoiceAct<sup>TM</sup> to experience life-changing simplicity and efficiency. We think you&#39;ll be hooked
						to the B.One Hub&#39;s ability to connect your home in a way that works for you; to make &#39;All
						Things. Be One<sup>(TM)</sup>&#39;.</p>
