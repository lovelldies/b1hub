			<p>With B.One VoiceAct<sup>TM</sup> skills for Alexa, you can control a broad range of smart Switches, Dimmers, Sockets/Outlets, Connected Lights, Thermostats and Actions with your voice commands. B.One VoiceAct<sup>TM</sup> also allows control of Infrared enabled devices such as Televisions, Air Conditioners, Disc Players and such others.</p>
			
			<p>The B.One skill can be added to the Alexa app and devices connected to the B.One Hub can be controlled directly via voice commands issued to Alexa. Imagine waking up in the morning and saying "Good morning, Alexa" to then have Alexa automatically turn on the coffee machine and the geyser! The possibilities are many &ndash; you can easily create and customize an exhaustive list of voice commands and their associated actions in the backend. Controlling individual devices is easy, too, thanks to Alexa's ability to recognize devices and respond appropriately to commands like "Alexa, turn TV off."</p>
			
			<p>Try VoiceAct<sup>TM</sup> to experience life-changing simplicity and efficiency. We think you'll be hooked to the B.One Hub's ability to connect your home in a way that works for you; to make 'All Things. Be One<sup>(TM)</sup>'.</p>
